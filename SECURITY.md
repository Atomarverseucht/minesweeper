# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The only supported version is the newest! I hope you understand that we don't have the capacities to support a few versions at the same time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue and we are doing our best to fix the vulnerability.
Please write in the issue, the version of the game, a little step-by-step guide to come to the vulnerability.
We cannot garantee a fast fix, it is dependent on the time resources of our small team and how big the problem is
